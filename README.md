# 015_USGS_Heatmaps
Leaflet mapping visualizations for USGS datasets.

The heatmaps display the locations, intensity, depth, magnitude, and frequency of earthquakes across the globe.

This project utilizes JavaScript (Leaflet) to create Interactive Dashboards to display data pulled via API.  
- Dataset was created by the United States Geological Survey.
